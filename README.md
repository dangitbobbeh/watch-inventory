## Features

### AI-Powered CSV Import

Upload any CSV format and Claude automatically maps columns to the correct fields—no manual configuration required.

- **Smart column detection**: "Price Paid" → `purchasePrice`, "S/N" → `serial`, "Sold For" → `salePrice`
- **Status normalization**: Handles 15+ variations ("For Sale", "Listed", "Available" → `in_stock`)
- **Flexible date parsing**: ISO, US (MM/DD/YYYY), European (DD-MM-YYYY), natural language
- **Currency formatting**: Strips symbols and commas ($12,500.00 → 12500)
- **Custom fields**: Columns that don't fit the schema are preserved as JSON
- **Two import modes**: Create new inventory OR update existing watches with sale data

### Trade Tracking

Record watch-for-watch trades with a guided wizard that handles the bookkeeping automatically.

- **4-step trade flow**: Select outgoing watch → Set trade value → Enter incoming watch details → Confirm
- **Cash difference support**: Even trades, trades where you receive cash, or trades where you pay cash
- **Automatic cost basis**: Calculates correct cost basis for the incoming watch
- **Linked records**: Trade relationships are tracked—see what you traded for what
- **Profit attribution**: Trade value counts as sale price for P&L calculations

### Inventory Management

- Track watches with detailed specs (brand, model, reference, serial, year, condition, accessories)
- Record full purchase details (source, price, shipping, service costs)
- Track sales with complete cost breakdown (platform fees, marketing, shipping, tax)
- Automatic profit/loss calculation per watch
- **Auto-sold status**: Adding a sale price automatically marks the watch as sold
- **Duplicate watch**: One-click duplication for when you buy the same model again
- Filter and search by brand, model, reference, status, source, or platform
- Sortable columns with pagination
